# 2024 Portfolio

I created my first portfolio quite early into my bootcamp and learning to code in general. I think my skills have increased a lot since then.
In addition i've been meaning to create a new portfolio to show off my new skills.

## plan

so i really want to work with Golang so ill use it for my server, then ofc js for the front end.

in the future, i plan on working with webgl and such so it'll be a good place to showcase my work with that.

### client

#### react & component libraries
    
    im not very good with css so i figure i should use some component libs and tailor to my needs

#### layout

    landing page
        "hi my name is alex"
        "im a web developer, with a focus on back end."
        "explore my website by scrolling or clicking menu items"
        or something

    contact me - button should be visible on every page
        download resume button
        send email
    
    About me
        identity
